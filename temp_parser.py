The error message "unterminated string literal" typically occurs when there is an unbalanced quote or apostrophe in your code. This can be caused by a missing closing quote or an extra closing quote. Here's a basic example of improved code to avoid this issue:

```python
import unittest
import tempfile

class TempParserTest(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_temp_parser(self):
        # Create a temporary file
        with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w+t') as f:
            # Write a string to the file
            f.write('This is a test string')
            # Seek back to the beginning of the file
            f.seek(0)
            # Read the contents of the file
            contents = f.read()
            # Strip the newline character
            contents = contents.strip()
            # Check that the contents match the expected string
            self.assertEqual(contents, 'This is a test string')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In this code:

- We import the `tempfile` module to create a temporary file.
- We create a test class `TempParserTest` that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`.
- Inside the test method `test_temp_parser`, we create a temporary file with `NamedTemporaryFile`. The `mode='w+t'` argument allows us to read and write to the file.
- We write a string to the file using the `write()` method.
- We seek back to the beginning of the file using `seek(0)`.
- We read the contents of the file using the `read()` method.
- We strip the newline character from the contents using `strip()`.
- Finally, we use the `assertEqual()` method to check that the contents match the expected string.

This code should run without any errors related to unterminated string literals.
